I have developed, over the years, complete, automated block level physical implementation and verification design flows and used/deployed them successfully for production tapeouts:

* Magma based netlist→GDSII flow: twice
* Cadence based netlist→GDSII flow: 4 times
* Cadence based RTL→GDSII flow: once
* RC extraction (STaR, Assura, QRC, Quantus): 4 times
* LVS/DRC/ERC/ANT (Mentor Calibre, Cadence Assura/PVS using TSMC decks): 4 times
* Cadence LEC (Conformal): 3 times
* Low Power Verification(Cadence Conformal-LP using CPF),
 Synopsys LEC (Formality),
 Sequence Cooltime STA flow, 
 Synopsys PT-SI STA flow,
 Cadence Tempus STA flow,
 Synopsys PTPX,
 Sequence Coolpower EM/IR,
 Apache Redhawk EM/IR, 
 Apache Seascape EM/IR,
 Cadence semi-custom Assura RC extraction,
 Cadence Abgen LEF generation: At least once
 
Few were built around EDA vendors' reference flows.

Though not primarily a programmer/coder, I have, over 30 years, programmed in 
many langauages.

TCL, Python, C-shell, Perl, C, R, Pascal : Thousands of lines  of code
Swift, MATLAB, Scala, SKILL, Objective-C : Hundreds of lines of code
