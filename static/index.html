Summary
=======
I have over 25 years of leading edge technical experience both as a 
leader and an individual contributor with a record of highly effective
and prolific execution. My strengths include good communication and 
analytical skills, breadth of knowledge and ingenuity.

I’m unable to relocate or travel outside the SF bay area.

Professional Experience
=======================

[16-17] Consultant, ZGlue Inc.
- Physical design methodology and netlist-to-gds flow development in 
  tcl using Cadence toolset. Also Assura physical verification and 
  logical equivalence (lec) flows.
- Hierarchical implementation of an instance array design including 
  floorplanning, power grid, pin placement, place and route, logical 
  equivalence and physical verification.
- Abstract generation of analog macros and hierarchical instance to 
  allow for through the block routing.
- Mixed-signal custom CAD support including SKILL programming
- Setup Virtuoso QRC extraction flow for full chip STA, set up and run
  full chip STA with Tempus, set up and run full chip LEC with 
  Conformal. Silicon success.
