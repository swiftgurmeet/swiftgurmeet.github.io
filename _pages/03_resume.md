## Summary

I was the best student in my class at [India's best engineering institution][iisc-wiki] and more. I have over 23 years of leading edge technical experience both as a leader and an individual contributor with a record of highly effective and prolific execution. My strengths include good communication and analytical skills, breadth of knowledge and ingenuity. 

I’m unable to relocate or travel outside the SF bay area.
