## Summary

While growing up, I gorged on science and electronics magazines like Popular Mechanics, Elektor Electronics, Popular Science, Science Today. As many other hobbyists, I came across a schematic of a crystal radio and decided to build it. I used some enamelled copper wire, a silicon diode, pair of high impedence headphones and a long wire antenna. No sound came out of the headphones. It took me another couple of years and becoming a teenager before I learnt that I needed a "crystal" diode like an OA79. By this time, I was closer to a powerful AM radio station....and by moving the ferrite rod inside a proper lintz wire based inductor, magic ....this was the sweetest sound I ever heard. All India Radio at 666 Khz. Few months later, I'd light up an L.E.D. using the energy from the same radio station. 

Soon, I was building all kind of electronic projects, like doorbells, radio transmitters, receivers, high voltage generators. I also spent considerable time "Dxing," or listening to far way radio stations. I still have the QSL (acknowledgement) cards from Radio Luxemberg, Radio Cyprus, Radio Sweden and others on medium wave frequencies.
