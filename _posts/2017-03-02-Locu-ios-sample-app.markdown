### Toy app called Locu using Swift 1.0

[This is an app][github-locu] I wrote as a learning project after learning swift from the Stanford iTunes course. The app uses a web JSON based API from "Locu" to get restaurants closest to a set of latitude/longitude coordinates and displays them on a map using the Swift map API in IOS. Tapping on a location pin further displays information about the venue.
